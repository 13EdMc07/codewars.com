A public repository for [codewars.com](https://www.codewars.com/), where [issues](https://github.com/Codewars/codewars.com/issues) can be tracked and [wiki](https://github.com/Codewars/codewars.com/wiki) documentation can be contributed to.

## When to log an issue

If the issue is related specifically to the execution of code (Test Frameworks, test output, etc) then a better place to log would be within the [Codewars Runner CLI repository](https://github.com/Codewars/codewars-runner-cli/issues).

If you are looking to express an interest in adding a new feature to Codewars, you may do so here. Please be sure to check that it hasn't been logged already.

## How to contribute to docs

The new documentaion is being worked on at: https://github.com/codewars/docs
